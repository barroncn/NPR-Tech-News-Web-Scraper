URI string that connects Mongoose to mLab
When youâ€™re ready to connect Mongoose with your remote database, you'll need to add it as an environment variable on Heroku (see instructions on GitLab)
MONGODB_URI: mongodb://heroku_js3dwzmf:oie62h9a583s7dv964173sfsd7@ds245337.mlab.com:45337/heroku_js3dwzmf

We are scraping data into objects correctly, but it says db is undefined (unhandled promise rejection)


Make main have more stuff so the only thing we are changing is what is in the results div....either saved or search results

When we click add note, we want to do a get to that id and return the data, then we can put it in the modal, and then launch the modal.


on the add note button--DON"T MAKE THAT THE MODAL TRIGGER!
make that do a get by id for the articles notes and then once we have that info returned as JSON data, we can manually populate the modal notes body and THEN
$('#myModal').modal('show')

when the user clicks save an article, the saved field gets changed to true
then wehn the user clicks saved articles to show all their saved articles, we get to the "/saved" and render index

if the user unsaves an article, delete from database and render "/saved"

if the user wants the search page, render "/" (if no data show no data message"

if the user wants to scrape, we "/scrape" then render "/" when done scraping



we're getting an empty array back when we go to the website for the first time, but then the page wont load....Nothing else is working
